Due to the space-saving and clever two-chamber design, the case can accommodate a Mini-ITX motherboard as well as a graphics card with a length of up to 325 mm. The graphics card is mounted vertically on the back of the motherboard tray, visually impressive. For this purpose, a suitable riser cable (PCIe 4.0) is included in the scope of delivery. Up to two 2.5- and 3.5-inch drives can also be accommodated in the VR3. If you install two 3.5-inch drives, the graphics card may be up to 185 mm long.</p><p>In addition to saving space, the concept of two separate chambers also brings advantages in cooling the components. In total, up to two 120mm fans or two 140mm fans can be installed in the case. In combination with the generous air passages that extend over the entire housing wall, excellent airflow is thus ensured. Alternatively, a 280mm radiator for water cooling can be installed on the front.</p><p>The Jonsbo VR3 is flexible when it comes to power supply. For particularly power-hungry gaming systems, a full blown ATX power supply can be installed here.

The DK-05F is already equipped with twelve 120 mm fans at the factory - which can be operated in five different modes thanks to the built-in fan controller and the buttons on the control panel. Four modes call up preset speed levels between 100 percent power and silent operation. The fifth mode allows the fans to be controlled via the PWM signal of the motherboard.</p><p>The housing has been specially designed for custom water cooling - and you can see that: in the front of the DK-05F, two removable radiator brackets each hold a 480 or 420 mm radiator. There is space for two 360 mm radiators in the bottom of the housing, also on removable brackets.

Using the height control on the control panel, the table can be brought into any desired position between 689 mm and 1175 mm. Up to four height positions can be saved and can be called up using dedicated buttons on the control panel.</p><p>The I / O panel in the front has one USB 3.1 Type-C and four USB 3.0 Type-A ports as well as two audio connections.

This makes it child's play to quickly\r\nand easily set up and dismantle a complete test platform - a dream for\r\noverclockers!</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<b>Compact\r\ndimensions and extremely low weight for maximum mobility</b><br>\r\nThe BC1 Mini V2 also becomes the perfect accessory for overclockers,\r\nenthusiasts, cryptocoin miners and specialists who need a benchtable that is\r\nconvenient to transport when traveling due to Streacom's typical choice of\r\nlightweight aluminum as the base plate material. The resulting weight of only\r\n785 grams speaks for itself. The design for mobile applications is also made\r\nclear by the practical carrying handle, through which the bench table can be\r\ntransported like a suitcase.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The manageable dimensions of 19 centimeters by 23 centimeters at a\r\nheight of 8.1 centimeters in the assembled state and just 8 millimeters in the\r\ntransport state do the rest. However, the lightweight is also relatively\r\nfiligree and thus subject to various weight restrictions. Power supplies may\r\nweigh a maximum of 8 kilograms and radiators per bracket a maximum of 5\r\nkilograms, while the permissible total weight of all installed components is 15\r\nkilograms.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<b>High versatility with versatile hardware support</b><br>\r\nA 140/120-millimeter fan can be attached to sliding brackets on the right and\r\nleft sides, which can alternatively give way to radiators up to 240\r\nmillimeters. In addition to knurled screws, spacers and brackets, the stands,\r\nwhich are also stowed in the base plate, have large, rubberized feet, which\r\nthus ensure a secure hold on common surfaces. The power supply is simply placed\r\nunder the bench table when assembled and can be attached to the base plate in\r\nthe desired orientation. Two 2.5-inch hard drives or SSDs can be discreetly\r\naccommodated on the underside opposite the PSU.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n<b>Tool-free assembly for best comfort</b><br>\r\nThanks to thumbscrews and push-pin spacers for the motherboard, all components\r\ncan be easily mounted with bare hands without tools, so a screwdriver is not\r\nnecessary. For optimum stability, all screws, spacers and brackets are made of\r\nsturdy steel. All protruding parts can be stowed fixed in the aluminum plate\r\nfor transport and thus the whole bench table can be moved to another location\r\nextremely easily.<o:p></o:p></p>", "technical_details": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b>Specifications:</b><br>\r\n- Dimensions: 230 x 8 / 81 x 190 mm (W x H x D, height dismantled/mounted)<br>\r\n- Material: aluminum (base plate), steel (screws, spacers)<br>\r\n- Weight: approx. 785g<br>\r\n- Color: Silver<br>\r\n- Form factor: Mini ITX, Mini DTX<br>\r\n- Motherboard spacer height: 25 mm<br>\r\n- Fan (optional, corresponding radiators up to 240 mm possible):<br>\r\n- 1 x 240 to 80 mm (left side)<br>\r\n- 1 x 240 to 80 mm (right side)<br>\r\n<b>Drive options:</b><br>\r\n- 2 x 2.5 inches<br>\r\n- Supported power supply formats: SFX/SFX-L<br>\r\n- Maximum power supply length: unlimited<br>\r\n- Maximum graphics card length: unlimited<br>\r\n- Maximum CPU cooler height: unlimited<br>\r\n- Maximum power supply weight: 8 kg<br>\r\n- Maximum radiator weight per bracket: 5 kg<br>\r\n- Permissible total weight of all components: 15 kg<br>\r\n- I/O panel: 2 x 12mm recesses<o:p></o:p></p>", "price": "132.99", "rating": null, "primary_image": "streacom-bc1-mini-v2-benchtable-silver-1.jpg", "primary_image_url": null, "sku": "GESC-094", "category": 1, "slug": "streacom-bc1-mini-v2-benchtable-silver", "is_active": true, "favourites": []}}, {"model": "products.product", "pk": 7, "fields": {"name": "Thunder X3 ED3 Gaming Table", "description": "<p>The gaming table in classic black comes with an ergonomically shaped table top in carbon look.</p><p>The stable board made of chipboard offers plenty of space for gaming hardware and peripherals and has a waterproof plastic coating.
